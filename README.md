# easytak

easytak is a very simple data package with some useful maps and a connection file to connect to the FTS public instance. 

This should make it very easy to get up and running on ATAK, and once on FTS Public you can download the certificate based data package. 

## Usage

* Download the zip to your device you are running ATAK on

* Access the menu via the three dots on the right of the menu tree

* Select "Import Manager"

* Select Local SD

* navigate to your Download dir or whever you put the zip file

* Select the zip file

The steps above should turn on the server link to FTS Public, and you should also have several new maps available to you. (Click the map symbol to select one)
